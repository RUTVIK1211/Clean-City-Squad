## About Clean City Squad

Collection and Dumping of Garbage is one ofthe serious problems we face nowadays. It is widespread problem in both urban and rural areas.Our project is a Web-application with City Municipal Corp. acting as an Admin and citizens as end-users. End users will be able to login and ping a location wherever they find any waste or garbage that needs to be collected. Along with the location, the user will also be adding snapshots which serves as a proof of validation for the admin. The admin receives requests from users for waste collection and then the request will be processed. Each user will be verified with their registered contact number and OTP so as to reduce any fake reporting. Each request sent by user will be having location cordinates which helps the collector to reach at the exact place where the waste needs to be collected.The aim of this project is to keep our surroundings clean by providing a medium for trash collection and dumping.
